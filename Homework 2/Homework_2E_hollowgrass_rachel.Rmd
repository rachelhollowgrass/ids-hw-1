### Section 3.7.1


**Exercise 2:** What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?

Both draw bar charts. The bars that 'geom_col()' draws reflect the data values, which allows then to be plotted with a second variable. The bars that 'geom_bar()' draws are the counts of those data values, which requires the variable to be plotted alone (with the count).

**geom_col()**: The y-axis tick labels show actual 'hwy' values.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

**geom_bar()**: The y-axis tick labels show counts of values.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = displ))
```
