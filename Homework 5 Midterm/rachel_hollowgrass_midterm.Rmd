# The tidyverse packages (3 points)  

**1. Can you name which package is associated with each task below?**  

**Plotting:** <code>ggplot</code>  

**Data munging/wrangling:** <code>dplyr</code>  

**Reshaping (speading and gathering) data**: <code>tidyr</code>  

**Importing/exporting data**: <code>readr</code>  

**2. Now can you name two functions that you’ve used from each package that you listed above for these tasks?**  

**Plotting:**  
<ul>
<li><code>geom_point()</code></li>
<li><code>geom_boxplot()</code></li>
</ul>

**Data munging/wrangling:**  
<ul>
<li><code>filter()</code></li>
<li><code>arrange()</code></li>
</ul>

**Reshaping data**:  
<ul>
<li><code>gather()</code></li>
<li><code>spread()</code></li>
</ul>

**Importing/exporting data** _(note that readRDS and saveRDS are base R functions)_:  
<ul>
<li><code>read_csv()</code></li>
<li><code>write_tsv()</code></li>
</ul>

# R Basics (1.5 points)

**1. Fix this code _with the fewest number of changes possible_ so it works:**  

The single change is to remove the exclamation point from the end of the variable name:  

```{r}
# My_data.name___is.too00ooLong! <- c( 1 , 2   , 3 )
My_data.name___is.too00ooLong <- c( 1 , 2   , 3 )
```

**2. Fix this code so it works:**  

**Changes:**  
<ul>
<li>Add a terminal single quote to the last item in the vector.</li>
<li>Change the "C" to lower case.</li>
</ul>  

```{r}
# my_string <- C('has', 'an', 'error', 'in', 'it)
my_string <- c('has', 'an', 'error', 'in', 'it')
```

**3. Look at the code below and comment on what happened to the values in the vector.**  

**Comment:** I assumed that the first, second and last items would have remained integers, but they were converted to strings. In a quick test, I see that unless all vector items are initially numeric, they are all converted to stings.   

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1, 2, '3', '4', 5)
my_vector

all_numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
all_numeric_vector

all_but_one_numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, '3', 4, 5)
all_but_one_numeric_vector
```

# Data import/export (3 points)

**1. Download the rail_trail.txt file from Canvas (in the Midterm Exam section here) and successfully import it into R. Prove that it was imported successfully by including your import code and taking a glimpse of the result.**  

```{r}
rail_trail_data <- read.csv('../data/rail_trail.txt', sep="|")
glimpse(rail_trail_data)
```

**2. Export the file into an R-specific format and name it “rail_trail.rds”. Make sure you define the path correctly so that you know where it gets saved. Then reload the file. Include your export and import code and take another glimpse.**  

```{r}
rail_trail_data <- read.csv('../data/rail_trail.txt', sep="|")
saveRDS(rail_trail_data, file = "../data/rail_trail.rds")
rail_trail_as_rds <- readRDS('../data/rail_trail.rds')
glimpse(rail_trail_as_rds)
```

# Visualization (6 points)  

**1. Critique the "Mrs. President" graphic: give only three examples of what is wrong with this graphic. Be concise.**  

```{r}
# ![](../images/mrs-president.jpg)
```

<ul>
<li>**Proximity:** The circles in the left column are touching each other, which suggests that they are related, but they are at best of two types (age ranges, and gender) and not related as implied.</li>
<li>**Size:** The promiment, varied sizes of the circles suggest that their size is important, but as circles the sizes are difficult to compare; however, casual observation suggests that the diameter of the circles more closely corresponds to the labeled values than their area.</li>
<li>**Color:** Color is used to differentiate between genders and not ages. This seems like a random choice.</li>
</ul>

**2. Reproduce this graphic [horizontal box plot] using the diamonds data set.**

i was not fully able to reproduce the original graphic. It looks like superimposing a stacked floating bar plot over the carat value would be a good approach, but I did not see an clear way to do that.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = carat, fill = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "CUT OF DIAMOND", y = "CARAT OF DIAMOND") + 
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
# Did not work:
# ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = carat)) +
#   geom_boxplot() + 
#   geom_col(aes(x = cut, y = carat, fill = factor(color))) + 
#   coord_flip()
```

**3. The previous graphic is not very useful. We can make it much more useful by changing one thing about it. Make the change and plot it again.**

The original graphic is not useful because it looks like the bars within the boxplots are hiding each other. By breaking out the <code>color</code> variable, it's easier to see how the colors are distributed wihin each <code>cut</code>.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = carat, fill = color)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "CUT OF DIAMOND", y = "CARAT OF DIAMOND") + 
  coord_flip()
```

# Data munging and wrangling (6 points)  

**1. Is this data “tidy”? If yes, leave it alone and go to the next problem. If no, make it tidy. Note: this data set is called table2 and is available in the tidyverse package. It should be ready for you to use after you’ve loaded the tidyverse package.**

No, the data is not tidy. There are two 'type' values ('cases' and 'population'), each of which should be its own variable.

```{r}
tidy_table2 <- spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
tidy_table2
```

**2. Create a new column in the diamonds data set called price_per_carat that shows the price of each diamond per carat (hint: divide). Only show me the code, not the output.**

<pre>
# Make a new column & variable for the price per carat.
diamond_prices <- select(diamonds, price, carat)
# Give the new variable the value of price divided by carats.
transmute(diamond_prices, price, carat, price_per_carat = price / carat)
</pre>

**2. For each cut of diamond in the diamonds data set, how many diamonds, and what proportion, have a price > 10000 and a carat < 1.5? There are several ways to get to an answer, but your solution must use the data wrangling verbs from the tidyverse in order to get credit.**

<ul>
<li>**Do the results make sense? Why?**</li>
</ul>

No, yes, investigate  

<ul>
<li>**Do we need to be wary of any of these numbers? Why?**</li>
</ul>

Maybe.
